This is designed for the business purpose of the owner who wants to grow his business by his programs and products.

Although the majority of the admin activities is done through the Django admin site.
This project also provides more common tasks such as adding, editing and deleting products through the web app's UI. 
Because of sensitivity involved in handling customer details I had to approach development from a security conscious perspective.
