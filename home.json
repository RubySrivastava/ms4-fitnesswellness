First impressions are hard to change but not only was the complex amazing to top it off they have some serious trainers. I knew I was in for some serious workouts when Mitch  pushed me as hard as Iâ€™d been in 5 years on the first day. Always with a smile but more importantly an awareness of my abilities Mitch and team are the reason I am coming back to train again. Want to push yourself with great people then this is the place."}}, {"model": "home.testimonial", "pk": 3, "fields": {"name": "Abhigyan", "email": "asds@sbhd.com", "testimony": "I  feel great, I have lost 4  kg in just 5 months at the gym. I go to the gym and do my own workouts 3 times a week and do 3 classes a week. I feel more confident as a person but most importantly to me I feel healthier and fitter, along side with a great eating plan I seem to be achieving weight loss I never ever thought I would. I have battled with my weight my entire life & never seem to lose the weight. I would always lose and little then pile it back on, but I really feel this time is different and I am so happy and proud of how far I have come. I still have a long way to go but I am definitely getting closer."}}, {"model": "home.testimonial", "pk": 4, "fields": {"name": "Sandy", "email": "sdad@sghdg.com", "testimony": "I would definitely recommend  Fitness Wellness and of course Personal Training. There's so many things I've learnt about myself and my training and it really has been a lifestyle change."}}]
